# Playstation Bot

It is really getting hard to get hands on a PlayStation 5 these days. The stock sells over in a second or never appears on any retailer's website.

This bot is designed to scan for stock inventory on targetted websites and add the console to a cart. Then it will alert the user to check out the product and vola!!!

## Pipeline

1. Setup basic project structure on GitHub.
2. Get a framework ready which covers all the priorities.
3. Test API vs Web scrapping for targetted websites.
4. Setup both API scrapping and web interaction to add the product to cart.
5. Setup quality unit tests that check the required functions.
6. Test the entire bot over different products on each of the retailers websites.
